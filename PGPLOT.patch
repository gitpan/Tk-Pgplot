The directory pgplot.patch contains modified/additional files from the 
pgplot 5.2.0 distribution:

  drivers.list               Added ptk to device list
  makemake                   Added ptk compile options
  drivers/pkdriv.c	     Dummy pgplot/tk driver
  drivers/ptk/ptkpgplot.c    Ported code from Tcl/Tk driver
  drivers/ptk/ptkpgplot.h
  sys_linux/...              Modified makedefs for Linux
  sys_sol2/...               Modified makedefs for Solaris
  sys_hp/...                 Modified makedefs for HP-UX

The main change to the ".conf" files in the inclusion of the PTK_INCL
definition. I have embedded a small perl script which should figure 
out the correct value for this, but is is probably worth verifing the
Makefile if you have compilation troubles. Set the value by hand if the
correct value is not found.

Currently this has been tested under Linux, Solaris and HP-UX. To get
this to work for other OSes, copy the section from one of the included 
.conf files the .conf file for your OS/compile combination.

You must compile the C wrappers to pgplot to get it to work from
perl. The Tcl/Tk code inserts a dummy driver into the normal libpgplot
so that applications not using the perl/tk driver do not have to link
with perl. When the perl/tk driver is wanted the dynamic linker should
load the correct objects.
